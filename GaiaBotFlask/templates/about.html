            At GaiaHarvesting, we have produced the GaiaBot as a solution to the
            ongoing labour shortages in the agricultural industry. The GaiaBot
            is a fully autonomous robot that is capable of harvesting crops and
            depositing them in a basket. The GaiaBot is equipped with a camera
            and sensors to detect the location of the crops and to avoid
            obstacles. The GaiaBot is also capable of returning to its charging
            port when its battery is low. The GaiaBot is designed to be
            user-friendly and easy to operate.
